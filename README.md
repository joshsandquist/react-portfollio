  ## Installation
  No installation required, runs in the browser.

  ## Usage
  This project was made using React as the front-end framework.I used mostly vanilla CSS for the styling, as I have been relying on lbraries a lot recently, however I did incorporate a bit of Bootstrap. This project used various forms of state management, mosty using the useState React hook. Of all the challenges, having the contact form error state update was the most difficult. However, after breaking down the problem, it turned out to be a much easier fix than anticipated. In the future, I plan to modularize the application even more with the components and styling. I am also planning on adding a MongoDB backend to the project as well.
